Prithvi (he/him) is a second-year graduate student in NYU's Archives and Public History program. He focuses on digital archives and collections the ways to ensure access and discoverability without sacrificing context and understanding. Currently, he balances two positions within NYU Libraries - the Digital Scholarship Services Specialist, and the Web Archives Assistant. He will graduate from NYU in 2026.
 
Originally from Singapore, Prithvi moved to the United States in 2019 to pursue a B.A. from Occidenal College in Los Angeles, and graduated in 2023 with a double-major in History and Diplomacy & World Affairs.

When he is not researching digital humanities tools or exploring archival records, he is bouldering at the local climbing gym, playing football (as in futbol), or playing with his cat, Dirt.

This is an in-progress build of my personal site. Keep an eye on this space - much more to come!
